      </div>
      <p className="text-center">
        Naizu is a community that began on the Hypixel in May 2020. What started as a small group in the Housing game
        mode quickly grew into one of the most recognized names on the platform, thanks to the success of PvP Hangout,
        one of Hypixel's most popular Housing experiences, consistently attracting over 50 concurrent players.

      <p className="text-center">
        None of this would have been possible without the dedication of our amazing staff team. Their creativity, hard
        work, and commitment to the community have been at the heart of everything we've built.
      </p>
      <p className="text-center">
        In 2025, we took a new step forward by launching Naizu SMP, a fresh project aimed at expanding our community and
        creating new adventures. We're excited to see where this journey takes us.
