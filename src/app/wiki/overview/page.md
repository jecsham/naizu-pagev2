## Overview

Welcome to our SMP server — a **vanilla-style Minecraft experience** with some **quality of life enhancements**. It’s designed to be a fun, safe, and community-driven place to enjoy a long-term Minecraft journey with friends.

- **Latest Version**: We will try to catch up with the latest version of Minecraft as soon as possible.
- **Minimal Plugins**: We keep things simple to preserve the vanilla feel, with small custom improvements for a better experience.
- **Anti-Cheat**: We use anti-cheat system powered by Vulcan to keep the game fair and fun for everyone.
- **Technical Players Welcome**: We encourage players who enjoy the technical side of Minecraft to join us. It is known that Paper can't get a 100% vanilla experience, but we try to keep it as close as possible.
- **Regular Backups**: Your builds and progress are safe in case something goes wrong.

### The Overworld

This is where most of the gameplay happens — building, exploring, surviving.

**Key features:**

- **Spawn Protection**: 150-block radius around spawn.
- **World Border**: 100,000 blocks from spawn (with plans to expand later).
- **PvP is ON!** Except in spawn and protected chunks by players.

### The Nether & The End

- **Chunk Protection Disabled**: You won’t be able to protect land here.
- **May Reset in Future**: To keep things fresh, the Nether and the End might be wiped periodically.
- **PvP is ON!**

### Notes

- We’re still finalizing how the **Nether** and **End** will be managed long-term.
- The server is a **work in progress**, and things may change as we grow.
- **Your feedback matters** — feel free to suggest features or share ideas!
- You will find additional and useful information in this wiki!

Thanks for being part of the journey!
