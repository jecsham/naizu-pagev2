## Get a Home
Having a _home_ is essential — it lets you easily set a teleport point to return to later. Ideally for long exploration trips or when you need to get back to your base quickly.

### Notes
- You can only have **one home**. This limit won’t change.
- Homes can only be set in the **Overworld**.
- The `/home` command has a **5-seconds delay**. Moving during this time cancels the teleport.


### Commands
Available commands for home management:

- `/homes` - Displays help for the home command
- `/sethome` - Sets your default home at your current location
- `/home` - Teleports you to your default home
- `/delhome` - Deletes your home


For additional commands, use `/homes help`.
