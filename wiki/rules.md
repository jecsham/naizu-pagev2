## Server Rules

These rules are designed to ensure a fun and fair experience for all players. By joining the server, you agree to follow these guidelines.

### No Cheating
- Hacked clients, x-ray, auto-clickers, or any **unfair** modifications are strictly prohibited.
- Only allowed mods: Performance mods (e.g., Sodium, OptiFine) and mini-maps without cave or x-ray features.

### World Usage
- Do not create redstone machines, farms, or contraptions that intentionally cause lag.
- Do not build within visual distance of another playerâ€™s base without their permission. Staff may intervene if necessary.

### Chat and Player Conduct
- Treat all players with respect.
- Hate speech, discrimination, harassment, or toxic behavior will result in removal from the server.

### Exploits and Bugs
- Do not exploit game or plugin bugs.
- Any discovered exploit must be reported to the staff immediately.
- Using glitches for personal advantage is strictly forbidden.

### General Conduct

### Consequences
- Breaking any of these rules may result in a warning, temporary ban, or permanent removal from the server.
- Staff will determine the severity of the action based on the situation.
- Staff reserves the right to modify these rules as needed.
