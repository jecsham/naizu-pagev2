## Traveling the World with Mounts

**Mounts** are flying creatures that help players travel across the Overworld without relying on instant teleportation. While slightly faster than walking, they’re intentionally slower than Elytra, preserving the natural pacing and exploration feel of Minecraft.

### Why Mounts Instead of Teleportation?

Although this is a vanilla-style SMP, we chose to add mounts as a **more immersive and balanced alternative** to teleport commands. Instant travel breaks the flow and scale of the world. Mounts, on the other hand, offer a convenient way to reach nearby places while still respecting time, distance, and terrain.

### Limitations & Notes

To keep the experience balanced and fair:

- Mounts can only be used in the **Overworld**.
- You must wait **10 minutes** before summoning another mount.
- Mounts are **slower than Elytra**.
- Mounts follow a fixed path — **you can’t control them manually**.
- The limit of traveling distance is **7500 blocks**. This may change in the future.

### Commands

Available commands of Mounts.

- `/mount coords <x> <z>` - Summons a mount to travel to specific coordinates.
- `/mount player <player>` - Ask another player to let you travel to their location in a mount.
- `/mtaccept <player>` - Accept a request from another player to travel to your location.

For additional commands, use `/mount help`.
