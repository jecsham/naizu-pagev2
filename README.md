### How to add new Wiki
Work with root `/wiki` directory

Follow the rules:
1. No-space file name (one word if possible). File names are used as url path.
2. Files must start with h2 (`## `) title. Those will be used as categories in the sidebar.
3. Subtitles starting with h3 (`### `) will appear as subcategory in the sidebar
